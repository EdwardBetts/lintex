"lintex" is a C program that removes auxilliary (La)TeX files that are
usually not needed after a (La)TeX run (log, aux, dvi, ... files);
they are however actually removed only if their modification time is
more recent than the one of the related TeX source.  The backup files
usually created by many editors are also removed.

"lintex" has been developed in an Unix environment, specifically under
Solaris 2; but should run on every Unix system supporting opendir,
readdir, closedir and lstat library calls.  A command file used under
VMS to achieve the same results, LINTEX.COM, is also encluded; note
however that it does not have all the functionalities of the C
program.  Under VMS you may define a VMS external command like:

                $ LINTEX :== @DISK:[DIRECTORY]LINTEX

A man file and a Makefile are included; examine the Makefile (a few
lines only), modify it if needed, then type "make" and (with root
privileges if the target directory is protected) "make install".

"lintex" is released under the GNU Public License agreement; enjoy!
Here follows an example run:

MLO@cmssun2 38 $ lintex -h
lintex version 1.06
Usage:
  lintex [-i] [-r] [-b ext] [-k] [dir [dir ... ]]
Purpose:
  removes unneeded TeX auxilliary files and editor backup files from the
  given directories (default: the current directory); the TeX files are
  actually removed only if their modification time is more recent than
  the one of the related TeX source.
Options:
  -i : asks the user before removing any file;
  -r : scans recursively the subdirectories of the given directories;
  -b : "ext" is the trailing string identifying editor backup files
       (defaults to "~").  -b "" avoids any cleanup of special files.
  -k : keeps final document (.pdf, .ps, .dvi)
