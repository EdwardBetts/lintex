.SH NAME
lintex \- removes TeX-related garbage files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR lintex " [ " "\-i" " ] [ " "\-r" " ] [ " "\-b ext" " ] [ " "\-p" " ]"
.RB " [ " "\-k" " ] [ " "\-o" " ] [ " "\-q" " ] [ " "\-v" " ] [ " "\-d" " ]"
.RI " [ " dir  " [ " dir " \|.\|.\|.\| ]]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lintex
is a program that removes TeX-related auxiliary files, normally not
needed after a successful TeX run (i.e. log, aux, dvi, \.\.\. files);
they are actually removed only if their modification timestamp is more
recent than the one of the related TeX source and if they aren't readonly.
In addition, all the backup files that your favorite editor has generated
are also removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i
Asks the user permission before actually removing any file.
.TP
.B \-r
The given directories are scanned recursively; i.e., if they contain
any subdirectory structure, all the tree will be cleaned up.
.TP
.B \-b ext
.B ext
is the trailer string (the \'extension\') that identifies the backup
files generated by your editor, e.g.
.BR "\-b .bak" ";"
.B ext
defaults to ~ (the tilde character), i.e. to the
.IR emacs
convention.  If
.B ext
includes characters having a special meaning for the shell, it must be
enclosed in quotes: e.g.
.B
\-b "~"
(equivalent to the default).  Specifying the null string, as in
.BR "\-b """"" ","
inhibits the cleanup of any special file.
.TP
.B \-p
Pretends, show what files would be removed but don't actually remove them.
.TP
.B \-k
Keeps final documents (.pdf, .ps, .dvi).
.TP
.B \-o
Permits the removal of files older than their sources.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet, only prints error messages.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose, prints which files were removed and which weren't.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug, prints the answers to all of life's questions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.SM
.I dir
The name(s), separated by whitespace, of one or more directories to be
cleaned; if missing, the default is the current directory.
