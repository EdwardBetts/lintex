.SH NAME
lintex \- removes TeX-related garbage files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR lintex " [ " "\-i" " ] [ " "\-r" " ] [ " "\-b ext" " ] [ " "\-p" " ]"
.RB " [ " "\-k" " ] [ " "\-o" " ] [ " "\-q" " ] [ " "\-v" " ] [ " "\-d" " ]"
.RI " [ " dir  " [ " dir " \|.\|.\|.\| ]]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lintex
is a program that removes TeX-related auxiliary files, normally not
needed after a successful TeX run (i.e. log, aux, dvi, \.\.\. files);
they are actually removed only if their modification timestamp is more
recent than the one of the related TeX source and if they aren't readonly.
In addition, all the backup files that your favorite editor has generated
are also removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i
Asks the user permission before actually removing any file.
.TP
.B \-r
The given directories are scanned recursively; i.e., if they contain
any subdirectory structure, all the tree will be cleaned up.
.TP
.B \-b ext
.B ext
is the trailer string (the \'extension\') that identifies the backup
files generated by your editor, e.g.
.BR "\-b .bak" ";"
.B ext
defaults to ~ (the tilde character), i.e. to the
.IR emacs
convention.  If
.B ext
includes characters having a special meaning for the shell, it must be
enclosed in quotes: e.g.
.B
\-b "~"
(equivalent to the default).  Specifying the null string, as in
.BR "\-b """"" ","
inhibits the cleanup of any special file.
.TP
.B \-p
Pretends, show what files would be removed but don't actually remove them.
.TP
.B \-k
Keeps final documents (.pdf, .ps, .dvi).
.TP
.B \-o
Permits the removal of files older than their sources.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet, only prints error messages.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose, prints which files were removed and which weren't.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug, prints the answers to all of life's questions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.SM
.I dir
The name(s), separated by whitespace, of one or more directories to be
cleaned; if missing, the default is the current directory.
.SH EXTENSIONS THAT GET REMOVED
All files ending in the following extensions may be removed when appropriate:

   .aux, .bbl, .blg, .dvi, .idx, .ilg, .ind, .lof, .log, .lot, .nav, .out,\
 .pdf, .ps, .snm, .thm, .toc, .toc.old, .synctex.gz, .xyc
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The \fBHOME\fP environment variable determines the location of the configuration
file, see \fBFILES\fP below.
.SH FILES
Users can create a configuration file \fI$HOME/.lintexrc\fP which optionally
contains the keys \fBremove-exts\fP and \fBkeep-exts\fP, each followed by a
Python style list of extensions to additionally remove or keep, respectively.
Each extension \fImust\fP be preceded by a period, e.g. ".pdf" and not "pdf".
The \fBkeep-exts\fP key is only used when the keep option (\fB\-k\fP) is passed.
Note that the extensions listed in the \fBkeep-exts\fP field replace the
defaults used by the \fB\-k\fP option. The \fBkeep-exts\fP option also takes
precedence over \fBremove-exts\fP: no file ending in an extension removed by
default or listed in \fBremove-exts\fP will be deleted if its extension is
listed in \fBkeep-exts\fP and the \fB\-k\fP option was passed. For example, the
configuration file

    keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".log"];
    remove-exts = [".txt", ".1"];

will keep any file ending in ".pdf", ".ps" or ".log" when lintex is called with
the \fP\-k\fP option (but \fInot\fP files ending in ".dvi"), and adds ".txt" and
".1" to the list of extensions to check for removal. The following configuration
file provides lintex with its default behaviour:

    keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".dvi"];
    remove-exts = [];
